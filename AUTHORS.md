## NOTES:

OBLIGE was written from scratch. It does not contain any code
from SLIGE (by David Chess) or from any other random level
generator.

OBLIGE uses a modified version of the Lua 5.1.5 scripting
language, which is Copyright 1994-2012 Lua.org, PUC-Rio, and
is under a permissive "MIT" license.

Part of the cave algorithm used in OBLIGE was described by Jim
Babcock in his article: "Cellular Automata Method for Generating
Random Cave-Like Levels".

OBLIGE uses the FLTK widget library (http://www.fltk.org)
